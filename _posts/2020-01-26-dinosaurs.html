<p>I have been teaching myself Java through an app called SoloLearn. Yesterday I was given a prompt to create a program that takes the amount of a loan from a friend and outputs the total amount left after 3 months and 10% interest a month.</p>

<p>I took the instructions a little too literally and created an output showing what 10% of each payment and the amount left after each month. </p>

<p>I was proud of myself! I didn't think it would format correctly. I'm still learning how to use the print statements.</p>

<p>This was really fun for me not only because the mental model of programming clicked a little more, but because I took it a step further. To save my work for later, I found a website explaining how to write the code in Notepad and compiling through the command line in Windows. I then ran the program in the command line. I really enjoyed how such a little prompt turned into such a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I'd like to post the progam here to run, but I haven't figured out how to yet. I'll post pictures instead.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
