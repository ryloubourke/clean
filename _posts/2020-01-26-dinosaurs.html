<p>I have been teaching myself Java through an app called SoloLearn. Yesterday I was given a prompt to create a program that takes the amount of a loan from a friend and outputs the total amount left after 3 months and 10% interest a month.</p>

<p>I took the instructions a little too literally and created an output showing what 10% of each payment and the amount left after each month. </p>

<p>I was proud of myself! I didn't think it would format correctly. I'm still learning how to use the print statements.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
